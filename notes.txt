Notes on partial v1 build (rev 5b054fae645)

Clearances for M2/M3 screws seem spot on. I didn't have any issues.

The button assembly is unstable and has way too much flex perpendicular to hinge.
 * When kept from bending out the top part it seems to be stable -> some extra notches on the underside of the buttons might fix the issue.
The button scratches against the top cover towards the center - more clearance might be necessary

The top cover's alignment notch for the bottom hole doesn't seem to fit.

The ball bearing holes in the cup seem a tiny bit too large (balls fall out, although I guess that could be fixed with a tiny amount of glue)
 - might want to look into replacing these with ball transfer units though

Neodymium magnets work well through 2x2mm PLA so magnetically attached wrist rests should be possible.
